## Overview
Statistical analysis of a new car model to assess the products MPG and suspension coils

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Results from linear regression show that vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to our p-value being lower than .05
* This linear model does effectively predict mpg for the MechaCar  as our R-squared is .71

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

* Total summary found suspension coils having a variance of 62.3 pounds per square inch, which would be under the allowed design specs of 100 pounds per square inch

* Further analysis of each lot, however, reveals that lot 3 has a variance well over the 100 pounds per square inch threshold while lots 1 and 2 have much lower variance and are still within design specifications
