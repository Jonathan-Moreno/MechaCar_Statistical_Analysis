* Results from linear regression show that vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to our p-value being lower than .05
* This linear model does effectively predict mpg for the MechaCar  as our R-squared is .71
